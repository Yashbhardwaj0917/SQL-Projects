## Queries
The project includes a set of SQL queries that explore various aspects of COVID-19 data, including:

- Retrieving COVID-19 death data by location and date.
- Calculating death percentages and infection rates.
- Identifying countries with the highest infection rates and death counts.
- Analyzing vaccination data and population coverage.

## Data Sources
The SQL queries in this project assume the availability of COVID-19 data in a SQL database with two tables:
- `CovidDeaths`: Contains COVID-19 death data, including location, date, total cases, total deaths, and population.
- `CovidVaccinations`: Contains COVID-19 vaccination data, including location, date, and new vaccinations.

Please ensure that you have the necessary data sources and database set up before running these queries.

## Usage
To use these SQL queries:

1. Make sure you have access to a SQL database with the required data tables (`CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccinations`).
2. Run the SQL queries in your preferred SQL client or environment.

## Documentation
This section provides an overview of the queries and their purposes:

- The `Queries` section lists and describes each SQL query included in the project.
- For each query, there is an explanation of its purpose and usage.
- In some cases, notes on query corrections or improvements are provided.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving existing queries or adding new ones, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
